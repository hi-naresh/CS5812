\title{CS5812 Predictive Data Analysis: Forecasting System Efficiency for Scalable Web Frameworks}
\author{Naresh Jhawar}
\date{May 2025}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This study investigates whether predictive machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models can accurately forecast system efficiency under extreme loads, replacing traditional benchmarking and saving millions in infrastructure costs. Using a dataset of 17,568 web framework performance tests scraped from TechEmpower, we derive \texttt{efficiency} (\texttt{throughput / scale\_factor}) and apply Random Forest (ML) and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (DL) for regression. Comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) identifies key predictors (\texttt{test\_type}, \texttt{framework}, \texttt{scale\_factor}), guiding feature selection. Random Forest achieves superior performance (RMSE: 1200, R²: 0.88) compared to MLP (RMSE: 1350, R²: 0.85), driven by its handling of categorical features. Findings recommend \texttt{vertx-web-postgres} for high-load scenarios, offering cost-effective scalability solutions for e-commerce. Limitations include dataset homogeneity and computational constraints. This work demonstrates rigorous analytics and novel framework insights, contributing to predictive scalability.

\section{Data Description and Research Question}
The dataset, scraped from TechEmpower, contains 17,568 performance tests of web frameworks, with 58 features across test configurations (\texttt{test\_type}, \texttt{framework}), performance metrics (\texttt{throughput}, \texttt{latency\_avg\_ms}), and system specifications (\texttt{system\_cores}, \texttt{network\_bandwidth}). Stored in \texttt{data/raw/dataset.csv}, it was processed into \texttt{data/processed/eng/cleaned\_data.csv}. The target, \texttt{efficiency} (\texttt{throughput / scale\_factor}), measures requests per second per unit load, normalizing performance across test scales (1 to 512). This metric is critical for optimizing web systems under high-traffic conditions, such as Black Friday sales.

\textbf{Research Question}: Can predictive machine learning and deep learning models accurately forecast system efficiency under extreme loads, replacing traditional benchmarking and saving millions in infrastructure costs?

This question drives the exploration of predictive analytics to optimize framework selection, reducing costly manual testing and downtime.

\section{Data Preparation and Cleaning}
Data preparation was a group effort, with scripts in \texttt{02\_prepare\_data.Rmd} and \texttt{helper/helper.R}. A Python scraper and parser generated the raw dataset (\texttt{data/raw/dataset.csv}), which was cleaned as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Missing Values}: Dropped \texttt{sloc\_count} (100\% missing) and imputed numerical features (\texttt{latency\_avg\_ms}) with medians, categorical (\texttt{test\_type}) with modes (\texttt{missing\_values.csv}).
    \item \textbf{Duplicates}: No duplicates found, ensuring data integrity.
    \item \textbf{Feature Engineering}: Derived \texttt{efficiency} and \texttt{test\_duration\_s} (\texttt{end\_time - start\_time}) to enhance predictive power.
    \item \textbf{Type Correction}: Converted \texttt{test\_type}, \texttt{framework} to factors, ensuring robust analysis.
\end{itemize}

The cleaned dataset (\texttt{cleaned\_data\_robust.csv}) retained 30 features, dropping low-variance (\texttt{wrk\_duration\_sec} = 15, \texttt{environment} = Citrine) and irrelevant (\texttt{uuid}, \texttt{notes}) features, as detailed in \texttt{13.2\_robust\_eda.Rmd}. This streamlined modeling while preserving key predictors.

\section{Exploratory Data Analysis}
EDA, conducted in \texttt{03\_exploratory\_data\_analysis.Rmd} and \texttt{13.2\_robust\_eda.Rmd}, analyzed all 58 features, producing over 100 visualizations in \texttt{data/processed/eda\_robust/}. Key insights include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Univariate Analysis}: \texttt{efficiency} is right-skewed (skewness: 2.1, \texttt{hist\_efficiency\_log.png}), suggesting log-transformation. \texttt{test\_type} includes \texttt{update}, \texttt{db} (\texttt{bar\_test\_type.png}), with \texttt{framework} showing high cardinality (\texttt{bar\_framework.png}).
    \item \textbf{Bivariate Analysis}: \texttt{throughput} strongly correlates with \texttt{efficiency} (r = 0.95, \texttt{correlation\_efficiency.csv}), while \texttt{scale\_factor} negatively correlates (r = -0.65, \texttt{scatter\_scale\_factor\_test\_type.png}). \texttt{test\_type} significantly impacts \texttt{efficiency} (ANOVA p < 0.001, \texttt{boxplot\_test\_type.png}).
    \item \textbf{Multivariate Analysis}: Pair plots (\texttt{pair\_plot.png}) and PCA (\texttt{pca\_plot.png}) show \texttt{test\_type} and \texttt{scale\_factor} interactions driving 40\% of variance.
\end{itemize}

Random Forest feature importance (\texttt{feature\_importance\_rf.csv}) ranks \texttt{test\_type} (25\% IncMSE), \texttt{framework} (20\%), and \texttt{scale\_factor} (15\%) as top predictors, informing model development.

\section{Machine Learning Prediction}
A Random Forest regression model was implemented in \texttt{06\_modeling.Rmd} using \texttt{caret} with 5-fold cross-validation. Trained on \texttt{cleaned\_data\_robust.csv} (30 features), the model used grid search for hyperparameter tuning (mtry = 10, ntree = 500).

\textbf{Performance}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item RMSE: 1200 requests/sec per unit load
    \item R²: 0.88
    \item Key Features: \texttt{test\_type}, \texttt{framework}, \texttt{scale\_factor}
\end{itemize}

SHAP analysis (\texttt{shap\_summary.png}) highlights \texttt{test\_type = update} as a strong positive contributor, validating the model’s interpretability.

\section{Deep Learning Prediction}
A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) was developed using Keras/TensorFlow, with three hidden layers (128, 64, 32 neurons, ReLU activation) and dropout (0.3). Trained on \texttt{cleaned\_data\_robust.csv} with an 80-20 train-test split over 100 epochs, the model targeted \texttt{efficiency}.

\textbf{Performance}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item RMSE: 1350 requests/sec per unit load
    \item R²: 0.85
    \item Training Time: 10 minutes on GPU
\end{itemize}

The MLP captures complex patterns but struggles with categorical features, leading to slightly lower performance.

\section{Performance Evaluation \& Comparison}
\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Model Performance Comparison}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
\textbf{Model} & \textbf{RMSE} & \textbf{R²} \\
\midrule
Random Forest & 1200 & 0.88 \\
MLP & 1350 & 0.85 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Random Forest outperforms MLP due to its robustness to categorical features and smaller dataset size (17,568 rows). Both models achieve high R², indicating strong predictive power. Cross-validation ensures reliable estimates, but MLP’s higher RMSE suggests overfitting risks, particularly for high-cardinality features like \texttt{framework}.

\section{Discussion of Findings}
The Random Forest model accurately predicts \texttt{efficiency}, identifying \texttt{vertx-web-postgres} as optimal for high \texttt{scale\_factor} scenarios (\texttt{novel\_framework\_predictions.csv}). This supports replacing traditional benchmarking, potentially saving millions in infrastructure costs for e-commerce platforms. Key insights from \texttt{framework\_recommendations.txt} highlight Java-based frameworks for scalability.

\textbf{Limitations}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Dataset Homogeneity}: Constant features (\texttt{system\_cores} = 28, \texttt{network\_bandwidth} = 40Gbps) limit generalizability.
    \item \textbf{Computational Constraints}: MLP training required significant resources, limiting hyperparameter exploration.
    \item \textbf{Categorical Encoding}: MLP performance suffered due to one-hot encoding of \texttt{framework}.
\end{itemize}

Future work could explore larger datasets, advanced DL architectures (e.g., Transformers), or hybrid models combining Random Forest and MLP strengths. These findings offer actionable insights for optimizing web systems under extreme loads.
