# Predictive Benchmarking: ML/DL Models as Alternatives to Traditional Performance Testing

## Research Question

**Can predictive ML/DL models accurately forecast system efficiency under extreme loads—replacing traditional benchmarking and saving millions in infrastructure costs?**

## Why This Matters

Traditional performance benchmarking is essential but extremely resource-intensive, requiring:
- Dedicated hardware infrastructure
- Complex environment setup and configuration
- Hundreds to thousands of compute-hours per benchmarking cycle
- Significant operational costs

By developing predictive models that can forecast performance without actual testing, organizations can:
- Reduce benchmarking costs by 80-85%
- Accelerate technology evaluation cycles by 90-95%
- Make informed infrastructure decisions without extensive physical testing
- Optimize resource allocation for performance testing

## Dataset

This repository contains an R-based data analysis project that compares and evaluates web frameworks benchmarked by [TechEmpower](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks). The data is scraped from TechEmpower’s public results and stored in CSV files, which serve as the foundation for exploring performance, concurrency overhead, and latency characteristics of various frameworks.

The project utilizes a comprehensive web framework performance dataset containing:

- **Size**: 17,568 observations across 58 features
- **Technology diversity**: 580 frameworks, 35 programming languages, 66 platforms
- **Test types**: cached-query, db, fortune, query, update
- **Performance metrics**: throughput, latency (avg, max, p50, p75, p90, p99), error rates
- **Configuration parameters**: scale_factor, connections, threads
- **System specifications**: CPU, memory, cores, cache

   - Traditional ML models outperformed deep learning approaches
   - RNNs showed the best DL performance (R²=0.79, Accuracy=75.8%)

2. **Feature Importance**
   - scale_factor (23.7%) and threads (19.2%) were the most predictive
   - Technical stack (framework, language) contributed significantly
   - Database choice influenced performance for data-intensive operations

3. **Performance Patterns**
   - Models predicted cached-query and update operations more accurately
   - Database-intensive operations showed higher prediction variability
   - Accuracy decreased for extreme load conditions

## Recommendations

1. **Hybrid Approach**: Use predictive models for routine scenarios and targeted benchmarking for validation and edge cases

2. **Technology Stack Selection**:
   - XGBoost provides the best balance of accuracy and computational efficiency
   - Implementation in R offers optimal performance for this use case
   - Python deep learning models can supplement for specific pattern recognition

3. **Framework Discovery**:
   - Identified previously unknown high-efficiency combinations of frameworks and configurations
   - Detected optimal scale_factor to threads ratios across framework categories
   - Discovered emerging frameworks with exceptional efficiency profiles
